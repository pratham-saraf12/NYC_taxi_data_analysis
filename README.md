# NYC_data analysis-python_projects
This project focuses on analyzing a Taxi Trip dataset to uncover insights and trends related to passenger behavior, trip characteristics, and payment patterns. The dataset includes various features such as the number of passengers, trip distance, payment type, fare amount, trip duration, and the time of day when the trips occurred. The primary goal is to process, clean, and explore this data to gain meaningful insights that can be used for decision-making and further analysis. At last will also create a model to predict Fare amount based on other features.

The analysis involves several key steps, including data loading, data cleaning, and transformation. The dataset contains both numerical and categorical variables, requiring different preprocessing techniques to ensure the data is ready for analysis. By examining patterns within the data, we aim to answer questions like: What times of day see the highest number of trips? How do payment methods vary across different trips? What are the characteristics of long versus short trips?

The project utilizes Pythonâ€™s Pandas library for data manipulation, along with other tools and techniques necessary for handling real-world datasets. This report provides a detailed overview of the steps taken, including code snippets and explanations, to guide through the data analysis process
